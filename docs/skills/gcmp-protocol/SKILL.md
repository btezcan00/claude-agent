# Model Privacy Protocol (Onder­mijning) — Skill Reference

## Overview
This skill provides quick, accurate guidance based on the **Model Privacy Protocol** for **binnengemeentelijke gegevensuitwisseling** (intra-municipal data sharing) in support of the **administrative/integrated approach to undermining crime (ondermijning)**.

It helps users navigate:
- The **4-phase workflow** (signal intake → weighting → source check → plan of approach)
- The **two privacy check moments** (Privacy check 1; Privacy check 2A/2B)
- The required legal reasoning: **purpose limitation / compatibility**, **necessity & proportionality**, and **subsidiarity**
- Practical safeguards: retention, information duties, and data minimization

## When to Use
Use this skill when you need to:
- Explain or apply **Phase 1–4** steps in the protocol
- Decide whether a signal is **in scope** (ondermijning + municipal task + municipal territory)
- Determine whether you may query sources using **hit/no-hit**
- Decide whether gathered data may be **shared internally** for case handling (2A) and for executing the chosen approach (2B)
- Clarify privacy/legal guardrails (AVG/UAVG + sectoral laws) and required documentation

## What This Skill Covers

### Phase Summary (Protocol Workflow)
**Phase 1 — Receipt & intake of the signal**
- Qualify: does the signal relate to **ondermijning** (using the checklist / indicators)?
- Check: is there a **municipal task or power** that could apply (2A)?
- Check: does it concern the **municipality’s territory** (2B)?

**Phase 2 — Weighting the signal**
- Assess **severity/concreteness/relevance** using objective local criteria.
- Decide: no action vs route internally vs route externally/RIEC vs continue to Phase 3.

**Phase 3 — Source research (Bronnenonderzoek)**
- Execute **Privacy check 1** to determine:
  - which municipal sources may be queried
  - hit/no-hit first (data minimization), then only relevant “what-information” if justified
- After hits: weigh results and decide whether to move to Phase 4.

**Phase 4 — Plan of approach (Plan van aanpak)**
- Before the signal/case meeting: do **Privacy check 2A** (what may be shared for deciding the approach).
- After approach is chosen: do **Privacy check 2B** (what sharing is allowed/necessary to execute the approach + intended legal powers).

### Privacy Checks (Core Logic)
**Privacy check 1 (start Phase 3)**
Answer per case:
A) What is the **legal basis** of the *primary* collection/use of the data?  
B) Is further use for “combatting undermining” **compatible** with the original purpose?
   - Apply the compatibility factors (context, data type, impact, safeguards, etc.)
C) Is it **necessary & proportionate**, and does it meet **subsidiarity**?
   - Start with hit/no-hit where possible; avoid opening underlying details unless needed.

**Privacy check 2A (start Phase 4)**
- Which of the gathered Phase 1–3 data may be **shared with which internal participants**
  to determine the approach?
- Share only with the domains that **need** it (role-based minimization).

**Privacy check 2B (during Phase 4 execution planning)**
- Given the chosen intervention and legal powers, confirm whether additional internal sharing is:
  - legally allowed (sectoral regime may restrict)
  - necessary and proportionate for the concrete execution

## Inputs This Skill Expects
Provide (as available):
- The **signal** (what happened, when, who/what is involved)
- Whether it concerns an **object** (location/premises) or **subject** (person/entity)
- The **suspected phenomenon** (e.g., exploitation, drugs, fraud, etc.)
- Intended **municipal task/power** you think might apply (if known)
- Which internal domains/sources might be relevant (if known)

## Outputs This Skill Should Produce
Depending on the request, return one of:
- A **phase-by-phase next step** (what to do now, what to document)
- A **privacy check decision summary**, including:
  - primary legal basis
  - compatibility reasoning
  - necessity/proportionality/subsidiarity notes
  - “hit/no-hit first” guidance
- A **sharing recommendation** for Phase 4:
  - who can receive what data (2A)
  - what additional sharing is allowed for execution (2B)
- A short **risk/guardrail note**: retention, transparency/information duties, and limits

## Guardrails & Non-Goals
- Do **not** invent legal permissions. If the applicable sectoral regime is unclear, state what must be verified.
- Prefer **minimal data use** and **hit/no-hit** before opening detailed records.
- The protocol is a **model**; municipalities must adapt it to local structure/policy
